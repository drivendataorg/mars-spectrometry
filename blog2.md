### Motivation

**Did Mars ever have livable environmental conditions?** NASA missions like the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers carry a rich array of instruments suited to collect data and build evidence towards answering this question. One particularly powerful capability they have is collecting rock and soil samples and taking measurements that can be used to determine their chemical makeup. These chemical characteristics can indicate whether the environment had livable conditions in the past.

When scientists on Earth receive sample data from the rover, they must rapidly analyze them and make difficult inferences about the chemistry in order to prioritize the next operations and send those instructions back to the rover. In an ideal world, scientists would be to deploy sufficiently powerful methods onboard rovers to autonomously guide science operations and reduce reliance on a "ground-in-the-loop" control operations model.

The goal of the [Mars Spectrometry Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/93/nasa-mars-spectrometry/>) was to to build a model to automatically analyze mass spectrometry data collected for Mars exploration in order to help scientists in their analysis of understanding the past habitability of Mars. **Improving methods for analyzing planetary data helps scientists more quickly and effectively conduct mission operations and maximize scientific learnings as they move toward this ideal.**

### Results

Over the course of the competition, participants tested over 600 solutions and were able to contribute powerful models to the analysis of rock and soil samples using mass spectrometry. To kick off the competition, DrivenData released a [benchmark solution](https://www.drivendata.co/blog/mars-spectrometry-benchmark/) that used a simple logistic regression model.

</div>

Overall, participants far outperformed the benchmark solution, with 446 out of 556 submissions besting the benchmark score. The log-loss established by the benchmark was 0.324 across all 10 compounds; our top performers achieved log-loss scores of 0.092, 0.116, and 0.119.

Competitors had a unique challenge when it came to the data on which their performance would be evaluated. Although most of the planetary soil analysis data available to scientists and our competitors is from commercial testbeds, which is cleaner, the ultimate goal of this mass spectrometry analysis is to produce a model that can perform as well on planetary soil sample data, which is scarcer and noisier. Therefore, a small portion of the training dataset contained samples from the SAM tested, a replica of the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite onboard the Curiosity rover.

The test set contained more samples from the SAM testbed than the training set, which made it especially important for competitors to avoid overfitting in order to achieve a good score. The bonus prize was awarded by a judging panel of subject matter experts, who reviewed solution write-ups by the five competitors who performed best on the SAM testbed data for technical merit and potential for application to future data.

To achieve these results, the winners brought a wide variety of creative strategies to this task! Below are a few common approaches across solutions.

- **An emphasis on feature engineering**: There was a distinction between the first place winner, who converted each mass spectrogram as a 2D image (temperature vs. m/z values), and the second and third place winners, engineered a variety of features to represent ion abundances across m/z and temperature. The second-place winner used area under the curve, peak value, peak-to-average, peak temperatures, width of peak, jitter, and then various statistics on the top three peaks, while the third place winner used the maximum temperature at the highest abundance, temperature range, and top 10 abundance values, among others.

- **Augmentation**: Both the first and second place winner used some form of augmentation. The first place winner used a few forms of image augmentation to represent a single sample 16 times, and the second place winner injected random noise using light Gaussian noise, feature dropout, row dropout, and other forms of augmentation.

- **Ensembling**: All of the winning solutions used some form of ensembling. Many trained multiple different types of deep learning model backbones. Some trained the same model backbone multiple times on different subsets, or "folds", of the data. Ensembling, particularly with folds, can help avoid overfitting a model on the training data.

<!-- - **Neural net-based models**: The first- and second-place winners used various net-based models, with the first place winner using CNNs and RNNs as a part of his ensemble, and the second-place winner using 2 Conv1d modules.

- **LGBM**: Both the second- and third-place models used LightGBM as one of the ensembled models, with the third-place winner using the outcome of the LGBM to a second-round model (catboost) in order to use information about the presence or absence of one compound to provide information about the presence or absence of others. -->

It's an interesting and unusual task, a new domain for me. It's a very exciting domain, not every day you can do something which may be used for Mars exploration!

**Summary of approach**

I represented the mass spectrogram as a 2D image (temperature vs m/z values) used as an input to CNN, RNN or transformer-based models. The diverse set of preprocessing configurations and models helped to achieve the diverse ensemble of models.

### David Lander

**Place:** 2nd Place

**Prize:** $7,500

**Hometown:** \[insert hometown here\]

**Username:** [_NQ_](https://www.drivendata.org/users/_NQ_/)

**Background**

**Summary of approach**

The best performing architecture was a neural network with 2 Conv1d modules, operating over temperature, followed by a Linear layer across m/z channels and then a multi-target classifier.

The network inputs are the first 100 m/z channels, with temperature binned into 25 degree increments. Temperatures included are roughly 100 to 1100 degrees, with random noise applied to produce a diverse set of models.

All Conv1d modules are kernel 3, stride 2, and the first layer involves dilations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100, with zero padding. All blocks use Group Normalization, Dropout (about 0.1), and Random ReLU (about 1/3 to 1/8 negative slope), with final layer dropout of 0.5.

Three different input scalings are used:
 - divide by sum of all m/z values at a given temperature (best)
 - divide by sum of all temperature values for a given m/z taken to the 0.5 - 1.0 power (second best)
 - divide by the maximum value across the entire array (third best)

Models include either the first, first and second, or all three channels, with substantial gains from ensembling all three approaches.

All models were trained for up to 100 epochs with SGDP *without* momentum at a learning rate of 0.1 and a batch size of 12.

**What are some other things you tried that didnâ€™t necessarily make it into the final workflow?**

Replacing the Linear layer aggregating across m/z with a Transformer would be a good first place to start, as there are clear relationships between ions. Improving performance on SAM samples is also possible with a CycleGAN model that translates between SAM spectra and commercial spectra (these were distinguishable with 100% accuracy).

**Place:** 3rd Place

**Prize:** $5,000

**Hometown:** Siliguri, West Bengal State, India

**Username:** [devnikhilmishra](https://www.drivendata.org/users/devnikhilmishra/)

**Background**

Hi, I am Nikhil Kumar Mishra, currently working as a Data Scientist for Okcredit, a startup in Bangalore.

**What motivated you to compete in this challenge?**

I loved participating in Data Science competitions, since the time I started to learn Data Science, and am always on the lookout for something interesting. I am also fortunate to have finished top 3 in many of them. I think I had never worked seriously on signal data before, so this challenge was a perfect way to hone my skills. Also a competition hosted by NASA on drivendata would surely bring a lot of amazing participants, so I could not pass this opportunity.

**Summary of approach**

I converted the multilabel problem into a binary classification problem. Given a combination of a sample_features + compound, tell if the compound is present in the sample. For a given sample, features were the same for each compound, except the feature telling which compound we were predicting.
I used lightgbm k fold ensemble model to get the initial predictions, then fed these predictions along with top 5k features to a 31 fold ensemble, catboost model  (which acted like a meta model). 2 stage modelling helped quite a lot in this competition, because the presence of one compound could help in the determination of others. Number of folds were high because I felt the data was quite small, so I wanted to have most of the samples in training.
I will describe the thought process behind feature-engineering now, as it was very crucial in this competition.

Almost all my feature engineering was done per m/z instead of per sample_id.

I pre-sorted each sample_idâ€™s data mass spectra by abundance in descending order, to help with feature creation, since signal characteristics near the peak were strong indicators of presence of compounds.

I saw was the signals were quite noisy specially from SAM test-bed, so I tried to smoothen the signals and convert them to fix length per m/z, per sample_id, so I could have fixed length features for each sample_id, this alone gave me a lot of boost in my score. After some trial and error I stuck to 25 length sequence, and created features for abundance and temperature using that, both with sorted by abundance and by their original time order

I followed the following steps, to get aggregation features per m/z, sorting the data in abundance descending order. (Please refer to the code too, as it might be tricky to read)

1. Firstly, create a list of values of k which basically tells to get top k values for each sample. Since all sample_ids had different length mass spectra, I normalized the length of each of the spectra, and then took top k% of the samples. k had values starting from 0.001 (top 0.1% of the values) to 0.2 (top 20%). 
2. Create features by aggregating abundance (normalized frequency, mean, standard_deviation) per m/z and temp_bin (temperature was binned per sample_id into 5 buckets)
3. Create features by aggregating temperature and abundance per m/z.
4. For features created in 2 and 3, I took the ratio of the features generated by current k, to the features generated by previous k.
5. I also created sample level features, like max_temperature at highest abundance, range of temperature and top 10 abundance values, etc.
6. Finally I created features by aggregating temp on m/z and abundance_bin (I binned abundance of each sample_id into 8 equal parts) for all the values (not top k values).

My general approach to feature engineering and modelling is to add a feature and keep it only if it helps in the model evaluation, and remove it if it doesn't improve the evaluation, feature generation and evaluation of the model must be done together.

**Place:** Bonus prize: SAM testbed modeling methodology

A subset of the test data for this competition comes from the SAM testbed, a replica of the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite onboard the Curiosity rover. The top five participants ranked by performance on just the SAM testbed samples will be invited to submit a brief write-up of their methodology. A judging panel of subject matter experts will review the finalists' write-ups and select a winner based on their solution's technical merits and its potential to be applied to future data.

**Summary of approach to SAM testbed data**

Overall the solution does not rely as much on pre- and postprocessing of the SAM testbed as on augmentation of the commercial data. The only difference in preprocessing for the SAM testbed data is that because the data looks noisier, the SAM testbed samples are averaged over 4-degree bins.

To avoid overfitting to the training dataset and make the models more generalisable to the SAM testbed samples, the following augmentations have been applied during training and prediction:
* Randomly choose to correct for background, either subtract the estimated baseline or simply a minimum value. In both cases, the random combination of 0.1%, 5%, 10% and 20% percentiles is subtracted.
* Random query of the abundance values from the overlapping temperature bands when converting to 2D image.
* Every m/z plot is randomly scaled by 2 random_normal(0 mean, sigma) with 1.0 or 0.5 sigma values.
* For some models, instead of normalizing data by maximum value over all measurements, m/z plots are normalized to 1 individually. Surprisingly, the models' performance was similar to the maximum scaling. So some models in the ensemble were trained with the max normalization and some with per m/z band normalization.
* Mixing two samples. 2D representations of two samples are mixed together, either as an average or maximum value with the label combined as maximum. Mixing a few available SAM testbed samples with commercial samples may help to generalize to other SAM testbed samples.

**If you were to continue working on this problem for the next year, what methods or techniques might you try in order to build on your work so far?**

With only 12 SAM testbed samples available for training and validation, and given such a drastic difference between the commercial and the SAM testbed data, I donâ€™t really expect the model to perform very well. Collecting more training samples is the most obvious and straightforward way to improve the model performance, but since the number of the SAM testbed samples is limited, just adding them to the training set is not the most efficient way. It may work better to use the extra samples and understanding of processes that caused the difference with the commercial data, to design the better augmentations processes (for example to generate the random background, similar to possible SAM testbed cases). Mixing the small number of the SAM testbed samples with a large number of available commercial data should also work as a very good augmentation technique.
